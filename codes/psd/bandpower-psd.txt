
%Determine the average power by first computing a PSD estimate using the periodogram. Input the PSD estimate to bandpower.

Create a signal consisting of a 100 Hz sine wave in additive N(0,1) white Gaussian noise. The sampling frequency is 1 kHz. 
Obtain the periodogram and use the 'psd' flag to compute the average power using the PSD estimate. 
Compare the result against the average power computed in the time domain.
